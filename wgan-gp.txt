Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty
WGAN uses weight clipping to achieve the 1-Lipschitz function, which can lead to
outlier values of surface and capacity underutilization, and gradient vanishing if the
weight clipping parameters are not carefully tuned. Doing so can lead to undesirable
behavior.
The Gradient Penalty is a light version of the Lipschitz constraint that follows from the
fact that functions are 1-Lipschitz if and only if the gradients are everywhere in the
norm at most 1. The square of the difference from the norm of 1 is used as the gradient
penalty.
WGAN-GP changes weight trimming by limiting to the gradient norm of the critic to
impose Lipschitz continuity. This permits for more stable network training than WGAN
and needs very small hyper-parameter tuning.
The primary advantage of WGAN-GP is its convergence. It facilitates training and is
therefore stable during training. Because WGAN-GP helps models converge better.

Gradient Penalty
The idea of Gradient Penalty is to enforce the constraint such that the gradients of the
critic’s output w.r.t the inputs to have unit norm. A soft version of this constraint with
a penalty on gradient norm on the samples x̂ ∈ ℙx̂. So the new objective is
L = Ex̄~Pg [f(x̄)] - Ex~Pr [f(x)] + λ E𝑥̂~P𝑥̂ [(||∇𝑥̂f(𝑥̂~)||2-1)2
]
In this equation the terms to the left of the sum is original critic loss and the term to the
right of the sum is gradient penalty.
ℙx̂ is distribution that is obtained by uniformly sampling along straight line between
the real and the generated distributions ℙr and ℙg. This is done because optimal critic
has the straight lines with the unit gradient norm between samples coupled from ℙr and
ℙg.
λ is the penalty coefficient and that is used to weight the gradient penalty term.
Batch Normalization is not used in the critic anymore because batch norm maps a batch
of inputs to the batch of outputs
